# Conditional gating overview

Conditional gating allows you to gate spaces with certain rules. It is driven by Push Chat rules engine which is inspired by json rules engine and allows you to create powerful dynamics guiding communication for your community. Some examples of what you can achieve with it —

- **Creating token gated spaces** - ie: user needs to hold XX token to join the space
- **Creating nft gated spaces** - ie: user needs to hold XX NFT to join the space
- **Defining multi-chain conditions** - ie: user can join the space if they have 5 tokens on Ethereum or 10 tokens on Polygon
- **Defining non-web3 conditions using Guild** - ie: user needs to follow `@pushprotocol` on twitter to be able to join the space
- **Creating game theories by combining one or multiple conditions** - ie: you need to hold 1000 tokens or 1 NFT or 20 POAPs, etc to join the space.

## Understanding the rules object

The **rules** object is an optional parameter that you pass in [create group API call](/docs/space/build/create-space) to conditional gate **joining** in a space.

### Overview

`rules`<br/>
├ `permission` - `entry` or `chat`<br/>
&emsp;└ `conditions`<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;└ `decider` - `any` or `all`<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;└`condition a` - `any` or `all`<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;└`criteria 1`<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;└`criteria 2`<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;└`condition b` - `any` or `all`<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;└`criteria 3`<br/>

_`rules`_ object is made up of individual **permissions** that define privilages of the space.

_`permission`_ object contains **conditions** that needs to be satisfied.

_`conditions`_ object is an array of one or more **condition**.

_`decider`_ the namespace (`any` or `all`) decides if all of the conditions or anyone of the condition needs to be fulfilled.

_`condition`_ contains array of **criteria**, the namespace (`any` or `all`) decides if all criterias or anyone of the criteria needs to be fulfilled.

_`criteria`_ is the atomic condition that has **type**, **category**, **subcategory** and **data**, based on which a particular condition is deemed as completed or failed.

To summarize, a list of **criteria** is created by you that is then defined inside **decider** to define their logical operation which is then passed in **conditions** of a particular **permission**. The list of individual **permission** is then attached to **rules** of the space to enable Push Chat rule engine to create dynamic communities with creative game theories.

### Criteria object Parameters

Criteria object supports multiple access control protocols which can have different conditions and rules, currently Push Spaces supports `PUSH` and `GUILD` type in criteria, owing to the way each individual protocol handles their respective **type**, **category**, **subcategory** and **data**, we are segregating the options and what they do for clarity.

#### When using type - `PUSH`

For `ERC20` or `ERC721` - supported conditions are `holder` or `owner` which means that the criteria will check if a wallet is owner or holder. For `CustomEndpoint`, the subcategory is `GET` or `POST` depending upon what HTTP request you want to use                                                               |                 |

## Use Case Example - Token gated space

### Problem Statement

We want to create a space where only our community members who hold $PUSH can join. Furthermore, we can enable anyone to join the space if they hold a minimum of atleast 1 $PUSH token either on Ethereum or Polygon.

### Solution

Let's break down the problem statement into individual requirements

**Group Join Permission:** We have two criteria over here:

- **Criteria 1**: User should have 1 $PUSH on Ethereum
- **Criteria 2**: User should have 1 $PUSH on Polygon

```typescript
// Push token on Ethereum Criteria
{
  "type": "PUSH", // define type that rules engine should go for
  "category": "ERC20", // define it's ERC20 token that you want to check, supports ERC721 as well
  "subcategory": "holder", // define if you are checking 'holder' or 'owner'
  "data": {
    "contract": "eip155:1:0xf418588522d5dd018b425E472991E52EBBeEEEEE", // $PUSH address on ETH
    "comparison": ">=", // what comparison needs to pass
    "amount": 1, // amount that needs to passed
    "decimals": 18, // the decimals for the token
  }
}
```

```typescript
// Push token on Polygon Criteria
{
  "type": "PUSH", // define type that rules engine should go for
  "category": "ERC20", // define it's ERC20 token that you want to check, supports ERC721 as well
  "subcategory": "holder", // define if you are checking 'holder' or 'owner'
  'data': {
    "contract": "eip155:137:0x58001cC1A9E17A20935079aB40B1B8f4Fc19EFd1", // $PUSH address on ETH
    "comparison": ">=", // what comparison needs to pass
    "amount": 1, // amount that needs to passed
    "decimals": 18, // the decimals for the token
  }
}
```

- Either of criteria should be able to allow user to join the space, this means that the condition's **namespace** to use to combine these criterias would be `any`

```typescript
// decider object - 'any' since either condition should allow access
"any": [
  {
    "type": "PUSH", // define type that rules engine should go for
    "category": "ERC20", // define it's ERC20 token that you want to check, supports ERC721 as well
    "subcategory": "holder", // define if you are checking 'holder' or 'owner'
    "data": {
      "contract": "eip155:137:0x58001cC1A9E17A20935079aB40B1B8f4Fc19EFd1", // $PUSH address on ETH
      "comparison": ">=", // what comparison needs to pass
      "amount": 1, // amount that needs to passed
      "decimals": 18, // the decimals for the token
    }
  },
  {
    "type": "PUSH", // define type that rules engine should go for
    "category": "ERC20", // define it's ERC20 token that you want to check, supports ERC721 as well
    "subcategory": "holder", // define if you are checking 'holder' or 'owner'
    "data": {
      "contract": "eip155:137:0x58001cC1A9E17A20935079aB40B1B8f4Fc19EFd1", // $PUSH address on ETH
      "comparison": ">=", // what comparison needs to pass
      "amount": 1, // amount that needs to passed
      "decimals": 18, // the decimals for the token
    }
  }
]
```

- Since there are no other conditions that are required, create the entire rules object, conditions only has one condition in entry so namespace for `conditions` doesn't matter but to keep things clear, we will mark it as `all`

```typescript
  "rules": {

          }
        ]
      }
    }
    // since we are not defining chat permissions, it means that any user who is part of the group can chat
  }
```

- Finally pass this rules object into the space that we are creating using the [create group API call](/docs/space/build/create-space).

```typescript
// Creating your token gated space
const createTokenGatedSpace = await userAlice.space.create("Push Community", {

  image: "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K...", // provide base64 encoded image

  admins: [], // not needed as per problem statement, can omit

                },
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## NFT gated space example

Below is an example of how to NFT gate `entry` to the space.

```js
import { PushAPI, CONSTANTS } from "@pushprotocol/restapi";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

// Creating a random signer from a wallet, ideally this is the wallet you will connect
const signer = ethers.Wallet.createRandom();

console.log(
  `Signer address: ${signer.address} | Signer private key: ${signer.privateKey}`,
);

// Initialize wallet user
// 'CONSTANTS.ENV.PROD' -> mainnet apps | 'CONSTANTS.ENV.STAGING' -> testnet apps
const userAlice = await PushAPI.initialize(signer, {
  env: CONSTANTS.ENV.STAGING,
});

// Creating your token gated community
const createTokenGatedGroup = await userAlice.space.create("Push Community", {
  description: "Token gated web3 native chat example", // provide short description of group
  image: "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0K...", // provide base64 encoded image
  members: [], // not needed, rules define this, can omit
  admins: [], // not needed as per problem statement, can omit
  rules: {
    entry: {
      // entry is based on conditions
      conditions: {
        any: [
          // any of the decider should allow entry
          {
            // decider 1 - If admin or owner invites someone
            any: [
              {
                // criteria 1
                type: "PUSH",
                category: "INVITE",
                subcategory: "DEFAULT",
                data: {
                  inviterRoles: ["ADMIN", "OWNER"],
                },
              },
            ],
          },
          {
            // decicder 2 - If wallet holds 1 NFT on polygon testnet
            any: [
              {
                // criteria 1
                type: "PUSH", // define type that rules engine should go for
                category: "ERC721", // define it's ERC20 token that you want to check, supports ERC721 as well
                subcategory: "holder", // define if you are checking 'holder'
                data: {
                  contract:
                    "eip155:80001:0x9105D95577575116948F5afcF479254f49F27939",
                  comparison: ">=", // what comparison needs to pass
                  amount: 1, // amount that needs to passed
                  decimals: 18,
                },
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  },
});

console.log("Chat created successfully!", createTokenGatedGroup);
```
